        <p>
            This app is designed to utilize OAuth2.0 and OpendID to issue an authorization token (to access your google profile info) and a JWT (to identify who is creating/querying datastore data) The app is going to perform the following:
        </p>
        <ol> 
            <li>
                After you click "Log In with Google", you will be redirected to log in to your google profile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you log in, you have authorized me to access your public information. I will use an authorization token to query the Google People API.
            </li>
            <li>
                I will then query your name information from the Google People API and display a page showing your first name, last name, your unique datastore ID, and the JWT token that was issued as part of the authentication.
            </li>
            <li>
                The backend will create a user account for you within datastore if this is your first time logging in.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now use the JWT displayed to create rentals and query rentals. The rental/user relationship will be stored within datastore.
            </li>
            <li>
                Begin by clicking "Log In With Google" below.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <button id="authorize">Log In With Google</button>
